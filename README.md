# NopCommerceAutomationTest
NopCommerceAutomationTest is a powerful automation app that has been developed as the final project in the AMIT learning center. The app is designed to apply test scenarios on a demo website called https://demo.nopcommerce.com/ by utilizing Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber BDD framework, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

The app demonstrates the functionality of automation testing by simulating multiple user journeys and interactions to identify problems or errors in the website's functionality. The app's main focus is to ensure that the website's quality is top-notch in terms of performance, usability, functionality, and security, hence ensuring user satisfaction.

The entire test suite has been developed using the Cucumber BDD framework, which facilitates smooth communication between the developers, testers, and product owners by specifying the requirements in a natural language format, which is easily understandable by all stakeholders.

Moreover, the project has been implemented using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which makes it easier to maintain code standards, separation of concerns, and reusability of code snippets. Each page element or function of the website is defined as classes with its respective locators and related function.

The app has been designed to be scalable and easy to maintain to keep up with changes in the website's functionality. It can be used as a model of what a robust automation testing suite should look like while also giving a clear idea of how to improve a testing suite's quality to improve its success rate.

In conclusion, NopCommerceAutomationTest is a hugely successful automation app that has proven its strength and usefulness in upholding the standards of website testing. With its well-executed implementation of Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber BDD framework, and POM design pattern, the app has raised the standards of automation testing.
